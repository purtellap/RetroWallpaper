Android Live Wallpaper App

This is a live wallpaper app which was originally developed as a group project with co-author Sam Ferguson and Michael Walling.  Afterwards I rebuilt it from the ground up (this repo) for my own purposes.  The app is now being updated in a private repository, but I decided to keep this one available.
